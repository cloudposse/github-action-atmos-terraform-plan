This Github Action is used to run Terraform plan for a single, Atmos-supported component and save the given planfile to S3 and DynamoDB.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps.


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).












## Introduction

This Github Action is used to run Terraform plan for a single, Atmos-supported component and save the given planfile to S3 and DynamoDB.

After running this action, apply Terraform with the companion action, [github-action-atmos-terraform-apply](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply)



## Usage



### Prerequisites

This GitHub Action requires AWS access for two different purposes. This action will attempt to first run `terraform plan` against a given component and 
then will use another role to save that given Terraform Plan to an S3 Bucket with metadata in a DynamoDB table. We recommend configuring 
[OpenID Connect with AWS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
to allow GitHub to assume roles in AWS and then deploying both a Terraform Plan role and a Terraform State role. 
For Cloud Posse documentation on setting up GitHub OIDC, see our [`github-oidc-provider` component](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/).

In order to store Terraform State, we configure an S3 Bucket to store plan files and a DynamoDB table to track plan metadata. Both will need to be deployed before running
this action. For more on setting up those components, see the `gitops` component (__documentation pending__). This action will then use the [github-action-terraform-plan-storage](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage) action to update these resources.

### Config

The action expects the atmos gitops configuration file to be present in the repository in `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`.
The config should have the following structure:

```yaml
  atmos-version: 1.45.3
  atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
  terraform-state-bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
  terraform-state-table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
  terraform-state-role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
  terraform-plan-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
  terraform-apply-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
  terraform-version: 1.5.2
  aws-region: us-east-2
  enable-infracost: false
  sort-by: .stack_slug
  group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")  
```

[!IMPORTANT]
>**Please note!** the `terraform-state-*` parameters refer to the S3 Bucket and corresponding meta storage DynamoDB table used to store the Terraform Plan files, and not the "Terraform State". These parameters will be renamed in a subsequent release.  


### Workflow example

```yaml
  name: "atmos-terraform-plan"

  on:
    workflow_dispatch: {}
    pull_request:
      types:
        - opened
        - synchronize
        - reopened
      branches:
        - main

  # These permissions are required for GitHub to assume roles in AWS
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: read

  jobs:
    plan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Plan Atmos Component
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
          with:
            component: "foobar"
            stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
            component-path: "components/terraform/s3-bucket"
            terraform-plan-role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-gbl-identity-gitops"
            terraform-state-bucket: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
            terraform-state-role: "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha"
            terraform-state-table: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
            aws-region: "us-east-2"

```

### Migrating from `v1` to `v2`

1.  `v2` drops the `component-path` variable and instead fetches if directly from the [`atmos.yaml` file](https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration/) automatically. Simply remove the `component-path` argument from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan` action.
2.  `v2` moves most of the `inputs` to the Atmos GitOps config path `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`. Simply create this file, transfer your settings to it, then remove the corresponding arguments from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan` action.
|         name             |
|--------------------------|
| `atmos-version`          |
| `atmos-config-path`      |
| `terraform-state-bucket` |
| `terraform-state-table`  |
| `terraform-state-role`   |
| `terraform-plan-role`    |
| `terraform-apply-role`   |
| `terraform-version`      |
| `aws-region`             |
| `enable-infracost`       |


If you want the same behavior in `v2` as in `v1` you should create config `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml` with the same variables as in `v1` inputs.

```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
```

Which would produce the same behavior as in `v1`, doing this:

```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      component-path: "components/terraform/s3-bucket"
      terraform-plan-role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-gbl-identity-gitops"
      terraform-state-bucket: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      terraform-state-role: "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha"
      terraform-state-table: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      aws-region: "us-east-2"
```

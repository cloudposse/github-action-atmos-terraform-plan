## Introduction

This Github Action is used to run Terraform plan for a single, Atmos-supported component and save the given planfile to S3 and DynamoDB.

After running this action, apply Terraform with the companion action, [github-action-atmos-terraform-apply](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply)




## Usage

### Prerequisites

This GitHub Action requires AWS access for two different purposes. This action will attempt to first run `terraform plan` against a given component and 
then will use another role to save that given Terraform Plan to an S3 Bucket with metadata in a DynamoDB table. We recommend configuring 
[OpenID Connect with AWS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
to allow GitHub to assume roles in AWS and then deploying both a Terraform Plan role and a Terraform State role. 
For Cloud Posse documentation on setting up GitHub OIDC, see our [`github-oidc-provider` component](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/).

In order to store Terraform State, we configure an S3 Bucket to store plan files and a DynamoDB table to track plan metadata. Both will need to be deployed before running
this action. For more on setting up those components, see the `gitops` component (__documentation pending__). This action will then use the [github-action-terraform-plan-storage](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage) action to update these resources.

### Config

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please note!** This GitHub Action only works with `atmos >= 1.99.0`.
> If you are using `atmos >= 1.63.0, < 1.99.0` please use `v2` or `v3` version of this action.  
> If you are using `atmos < 1.63.0` please use `v1` version of this action.

The action expects the atmos configuration file `atmos.yaml` to be present in the repository.

The action supports AWS and Azure to store Terraform plan files. 
You can read more about plan storage in the [cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage?tab=readme-ov-file#aws-default) documentation. 
Depending on the cloud provider, the following fields should be set in the `atmos.yaml`:

#### AWS

The config should have the following structure:

```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    gitops:
      opentofu-version: 1.7.3
      terraform-version: 1.5.2
      infracost-enabled: false
      artifact-storage:
        plan-repository-type: s3
        metadata-repository-type: dynamo
        region: us-east-2
        bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
        table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-plan-storage
        role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
      role:
        # Set `plan` empty if you don't want to assume IAM role before terraform plan  
        plan: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
        apply: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
      matrix:
        sort-by: .stack_slug
        group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")
```

#### Azure

The config should have the following structure:

```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    gitops:
      opentofu-version: 1.7.3  
      terraform-version: 1.5.2
      infracost-enabled: false
      artifact-storage:
        plan-repository-type: azureblob
        metadata-repository-type: cosmos
        blob-account-name: tfplans
        blob-container-name: plans
        cosmos-container-name: terraform-plan-storage
        cosmos-database-name: terraform-plan-storage
        cosmos-endpoint: "https://my-cosmo-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
      # We remove the `role` section as it is AWS specific
      matrix:
        sort-by: .stack_slug
        group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")
```

### Stack level configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wherever it is possible to specify `integration.github.gitops` on stack level 
> it is required to define default values in `atmos.yaml`

It is possible to override integration settings on a stack level by defining `settings.integrations`.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    foobar:
      settings:
        integrations:
          github:
            gitops:
              artifact-storage:
                bucket: cptest-plat-ue2-auto-gitops
                table: cptest-plat-ue2-auto-gitops-plan-storage
                role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-plat-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
              role:
                # Set `plan` empty if you don't want to assume IAM role before terraform plan  
                plan: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-plat-gbl-identity-gitops
                apply: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-plat-gbl-identity-gitops
```  

### Support OpenTofu

This action supports [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please note!** OpenTofu supported by Atmos `>= 1.73.0`.
> For details [read](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/projects/configuration/opentofu/)

To enable OpenTofu add the following settings to `atmos.yaml`
  * Set the `opentofu-version` in the `atmos.yaml` to the desired version
  * Set `components.terraform.command` to `tofu`

#### Example

```yaml

components:
  terraform:
    command: tofu

...

integrations:
  github:
    gitops:
      opentofu-version: 1.7.3
      ...
```
  
### Workflow example

```yaml
  name: "atmos-terraform-plan"

  on:
    workflow_dispatch: {}
    pull_request:
      types:
        - opened
        - synchronize
        - reopened
      branches:
        - main

  # These permissions are required for GitHub to assume roles in AWS
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: read

  jobs:
    plan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Plan Atmos Component
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v2
          with:
            component: "foobar"
            stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
            atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
            atmos-version: 1.81.0
```

### Migrating from `v3` to `v4`

The notable changes in `v4` are:

- `v4` works only with `atmos >= 1.99.0`
- `v4` support azure plan and metadata storage
- `v4` supports stack level integration gitops settings 
- `v4` allow to skip internal checkout with `skip-checkout` input
- `v4` support creating summary comments to PR

The only required migration step is updating atmos version to `>= 1.99.0` 

### Migrating from `v2` to `v3`

The notable changes in `v3` are:

- `v3` use `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to share artifacts so it is not compatible with `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-detection` `< v2.0.0`
- `v3` support .terraform caching to performance improvment


No special migration steps required

### Migrating from `v1` to `v2`

The notable changes in `v2` are:

- `v2` works only with `atmos >= 1.63.0`
- `v2` drops `install-terraform` input because terraform is not required for affected stacks call
- `v2` drops `atmos-gitops-config-path` input and the `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml` config file. Now you have to use GitHub Actions environment variables to specify the location of the `atmos.yaml`.

The following configuration fields now moved to GitHub action inputs with the same names

|         name            |
|-------------------------|
| `atmos-version`         |
| `atmos-config-path`     |


The following configuration fields moved to the `atmos.yaml` configuration file. 

|              name        |   YAML path in `atmos.yaml`                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `aws-region`             | `integrations.github.gitops.artifact-storage.region`     | 
| `terraform-state-bucket` | `integrations.github.gitops.artifact-storage.bucket`     |
| `terraform-state-table`  | `integrations.github.gitops.artifact-storage.table`      |
| `terraform-state-role`   | `integrations.github.gitops.artifact-storage.role`       |
| `terraform-plan-role`    | `integrations.github.gitops.role.plan`          |
| `terraform-apply-role`   | `integrations.github.gitops.role.apply`         |
| `terraform-version`      | `integrations.github.gitops.terraform-version`  |
| `enable-infracost`       |  `integrations.github.gitops.infracost-enabled` |
| `sort-by`                |  `integrations.github.gitops.matrix.sort-by`    |
| `group-by`               |  `integrations.github.gitops.matrix.group-by`   |


For example, to migrate from `v1` to `v2`, you should have something similar to the following in your `atmos.yaml`: 

`./.github/config/atmos.yaml`
```yaml
# ... your existing configuration

integrations:
  github:
    gitops:
      terraform-version: 1.5.2
      infracost-enabled: false
      artifact-storage:
        region: us-east-2
        bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
        table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-plan-storage
        role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
      role:
        plan: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
        apply: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
      matrix:
        sort-by: .stack_slug
        group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")
```

`.github/workflows/main.yaml`
```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v2
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
      atmos-version: 1.63.0
``` 

This corresponds to the `v1` configuration (deprecated) below.

The `v1` configuration file `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml` looked like this:
```yaml
atmos-version: 1.45.3
atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
terraform-state-bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
terraform-state-table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
terraform-state-role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
terraform-plan-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
terraform-apply-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
terraform-version: 1.5.2
aws-region: us-east-2
enable-infracost: false
sort-by: .stack_slug
group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")  
```

And the `v1` GitHub Action Workflow looked like this.

`.github/workflows/main.yaml`
```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
```
  
### Migrating from `v1` to `v2`

1.  `v2` drops the `component-path` variable and instead fetches if directly from the [`atmos.yaml` file](https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration/) automatically. Simply remove the `component-path` argument from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan` action.
2.  `v2` moves most of the `inputs` to the Atmos GitOps config path `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`. Simply create this file, transfer your settings to it, then remove the corresponding arguments from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan` action.
|         name             |
|--------------------------|
| `atmos-version`          |
| `atmos-config-path`      |
| `terraform-state-bucket` |
| `terraform-state-table`  |
| `terraform-state-role`   |
| `terraform-plan-role`    |
| `terraform-apply-role`   |
| `terraform-version`      |
| `aws-region`             |
| `enable-infracost`       |


If you want the same behavior in `v2` as in `v1` you should create config `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml` with the same variables as in `v1` inputs.

```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
```

Which would produce the same behavior as in `v1`, doing this:

```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      component-path: "components/terraform/s3-bucket"
      terraform-plan-role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-gbl-identity-gitops"
      terraform-state-bucket: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      terraform-state-role: "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha"
      terraform-state-table: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      aws-region: "us-east-2"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Introduction

This Github Action is used to run Terraform plan for a single, Atmos-supported component and save the given planfile to S3 and DynamoDB.

After running this action, apply Terraform with the companion action, [github-action-atmos-terraform-apply](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply)



## Usage



### Prerequisites

This GitHub Action requires AWS access for two different purposes. This action will attempt to first run `terraform plan` against a given component and 
then will use another role to save that given Terraform Plan to an S3 Bucket with metadata in a DynamoDB table. We recommend configuring 
[OpenID Connect with AWS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
to allow GitHub to assume roles in AWS and then deploying both a Terraform Plan role and a Terraform State role. 
For Cloud Posse documentation on setting up GitHub OIDC, see our [`github-oidc-provider` component](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/).

In order to store Terraform State, we configure an S3 Bucket to store plan files and a DynamoDB table to track plan metadata. Both will need to be deployed before running
this action. For more on setting up those components, see the `gitops` component (__documentation pending__). This action will then use the [github-action-terraform-plan-storage](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage) action to update these resources.

### Config

The action expects the atmos configuration file `atmos.yaml` to be present in the repository and contains.
The config should have the following structure:

```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    gitops:
      terraform-version: 1.5.2
      infracost-enabled: false
      storage:
        region: us-east-2
        bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
        table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-plan-storage
        role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
      role:
        plan: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
        apply: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
      matrix:
        sort-by: .stack_slug
        group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please note!** the action works only with `atmos >= 1.63.0`. If you are using `atmos < 1.63.0` please use `v2` of the action.    


### Workflow example

```yaml
  name: "atmos-terraform-plan"

  on:
    workflow_dispatch: {}
    pull_request:
      types:
        - opened
        - synchronize
        - reopened
      branches:
        - main

  # These permissions are required for GitHub to assume roles in AWS
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: read

  jobs:
    plan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Plan Atmos Component
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v2
          with:
            component: "foobar"
            stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
            atmos-config-path: ./
            atmos-version: 1.63.0
```

### Migrating from `v1` to `v2`

`v2` works only with `atmos >= 1.63.0`

`v2` drops `install-terraform` input because terraform is not required for affected stacks call

`v2` drop `atmos-gitops-config-path` input and  `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`  config. Now you have to use GitHub actions inputs and `atmos.yaml` to specify that configuration.

The following configuration fields now moved to GitHub action inputs with the same names

|         name            |
|-------------------------|
| `atmos-version`         |
| `atmos-config-path`     |


The following configuration fields are now moved to `atmos.yaml` 

|              name        |    path in `atmos.yaml`                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `aws-region`             | `integrations.github.gitops.storage.region`     | 
| `terraform-state-bucket` | `integrations.github.gitops.storage.bucket`     |
| `terraform-state-table`  | `integrations.github.gitops.storage.table`      |
| `terraform-state-role`   | `integrations.github.gitops.storage.role`       |
| `terraform-plan-role`    | `integrations.github.gitops.role.plan`          |
| `terraform-apply-role`   | `integrations.github.gitops.role.apply`         |
| `terraform-version`      | `integrations.github.gitops.terraform-version`  |
| `enable-infracost`       |  `integrations.github.gitops.infracost-enabled` |
| `sort-by`                |  `integrations.github.gitops.matrix.sort-by`    |
| `group-by`               |  `integrations.github.gitops.matrix.group-by`   |


If you want `v2` having the same behaviour as `v1` you should  have 

`atmos.yaml`
```yaml
...

integrations:
  github:
    gitops:
      terraform-version: 1.5.2
      infracost-enabled: false
      storage:
        region: us-east-2
        bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
        table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-plan-storage
        role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
      role:
        plan: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
        apply: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
      matrix:
        sort-by: .stack_slug
        group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")

...
```

`.github/workflows/main.yaml`
```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v2
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      atmos-config-path: ./
      atmos-version: 1.63.0
``` 

same behaviour as

`./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`
```yaml
atmos-version: 1.45.3
atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
terraform-state-bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
terraform-state-table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
terraform-state-role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
terraform-plan-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
terraform-apply-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
terraform-version: 1.5.2
aws-region: us-east-2
enable-infracost: false
sort-by: .stack_slug
group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")  
```

`.github/workflows/main.yaml`
```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
```
  
### Migrating from `v1` to `v2`

1.  `v2` drops the `component-path` variable and instead fetches if directly from the [`atmos.yaml` file](https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration/) automatically. Simply remove the `component-path` argument from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan` action.
2.  `v2` moves most of the `inputs` to the Atmos GitOps config path `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`. Simply create this file, transfer your settings to it, then remove the corresponding arguments from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan` action.
|         name             |
|--------------------------|
| `atmos-version`          |
| `atmos-config-path`      |
| `terraform-state-bucket` |
| `terraform-state-table`  |
| `terraform-state-role`   |
| `terraform-plan-role`    |
| `terraform-apply-role`   |
| `terraform-version`      |
| `aws-region`             |
| `enable-infracost`       |


If you want the same behavior in `v2` as in `v1` you should create config `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml` with the same variables as in `v1` inputs.

```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
```

Which would produce the same behavior as in `v1`, doing this:

```yaml
  - name: Plan Atmos Component
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      component-path: "components/terraform/s3-bucket"
      terraform-plan-role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-gbl-identity-gitops"
      terraform-state-bucket: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      terraform-state-role: "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha"
      terraform-state-table: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      aws-region: "us-east-2"
```
